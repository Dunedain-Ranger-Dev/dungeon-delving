/**
 * Town tiers (DD-99, docs/design/realm.md). A town starts as ruins (tier 0) and grows to a city (tier 5), whoever holds
 * it. Each turn, a held town with wealth to spare (the tier-up's {@link #cost}, plus {@link #RESERVE} kept back for
 * repairs; ruins need nothing), whose holder has the {@link #food} for it, and no raid damage still being rebuilt spends it and starts upgrading. An upgrade takes
 * {@link #DAYS_PER_TIER} turns (days) for each tier it's growing to, and while it lasts the town gets no other support:
 * no reinforcing, no wealth, no repairs. Done, it goes up a tier and gains {@link #DEFENSE_PER_TIER} defense. Its tier
 * makes its guards stronger (see {@code TownGuard.equip}), and so higher level, and lets more of them turn out; ruins
 * have none, and only ruins can be captured (see {@link RealmRaids#capturable}).
